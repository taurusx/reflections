When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It is very important to keep a remote repository when you work with other 
    people. In that case any member of your team has access to the same code 
    versions or can update and merge new parts of code. You can also create a 
    remote repository if you just want to share your code to public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When you pull changes from the remote repository you add newly created or 
    added files that somebody else might have provided. You update then your 
    checkout branch. If this was done automatically, you could meet some problems 
    with a code you were not expecting to be there. It is much better when 
    you decide whether to pull desired branch or not.
